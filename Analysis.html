        <h2>Current Situation in Bangladesh</h2>
        <p>After fleeing the violence in Myanmar, over a million Rohingya refugees sought safety in Bangladesh, primarily settling in the Cox's Bazar district. Cox's Bazar hosts the 
            largest refugee camp in the world, with crowded living conditions and limited resources.</p>

            <p>Overcrowded Refugee Camps: The refugee camps are densely populated, with inadequate shelter and infrastructure. Families often live in makeshift shelters made of bamboo and tarpaulin, providing little protection against natural elements like heavy monsoon rains and cyclones.</p>

            <p>Food and Water Shortages: Food security remains a critical issue in the camps, with refugees relying heavily on aid from international organizations like the World Food Programme (WFP). Clean drinking water is scarce, and many refugees have to wait in long lines to access water sources. Sanitation facilities are also limited, contributing to health risks.</p>
            
            <p>Healthcare Challenges: With a high population density and poor living conditions, the camps face outbreaks of communicable diseases like cholera and diphtheria. Access to healthcare is limited, and mental health support is scarce despite the trauma many refugees have experienced.</p>
            
            <p>Barriers: Many Rohingya children have little to no access to formal education, as the temporary learning centers in the camps lack resources and trained teachers. This has resulted in a generation of children growing up without the skills and knowledge needed for the future.</p>

        <h2>International Response</h2>
        <p>The international response to the Rohingya crisis has been varied, with a mix of humanitarian aid, diplomatic pressure, and calls for accountability. </p>

        <p>The UN has been vocal in advocating for the rights of the Rohingya and has declared the 2017 violence a "textbook example of ethnic cleansing." The UNHCR and other agencies have provided critical aid, including food, shelter, and medical services, 
            but funding remains a major challenge. Various NGOs and international organizations have been working on the ground to provide life-saving assistance. This includes Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders) providing healthcare and Save the 
            Children setting up learning centers. However, the scale of need far outstrips available resources.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Countries around the world have applied pressure on Myanmar's government to allow the safe return of Rohingya refugees. However, Myanmar has been resistant to accepting international investigations and has not fully cooperated with the repatriation process, leaving the refugees in limbo.
        While initial pledges of aid were significant, sustained funding has been difficult to secure. The humanitarian response plan is frequently underfunded, affecting the provision of essential services in the camps. This shortfall threatens long-term support for refugees.</p>
