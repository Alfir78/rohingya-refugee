        <h2>History of the Rohingya People</h2>
        <p>The Rohingya are an ethnic minority primarily from Myanmar's Rakhine State, with a distinct cultural and linguistic heritage that sets them 
            apart from other ethnic groups in Myanmar. For centuries, they have lived in Myanmar, but their presence has been a point of contention, 
            especially following Myanmar's independence in 1948. The 1982 Citizenship Law in Myanmar effectively rendered the Rohingya stateless, denying them citizenship and basic rights, including 
            freedom of movement and access to education and healthcare. This legal status fueled a cycle of marginalization, oppression, and violence. The Rohingya were subject to systemic discrimination, 
            including restricted access to job opportunities and land ownership, leading many to flee the country over the decades. The situation dramatically escalated in 2017 when military-led attacks targeted 
            Rohingya communities, causing over 700,000 people to flee to neighboring Bangladesh.</p>

            <h3>Causes of the Crisis</h3>
            <p>The Rohingya crisis stems from a complex interplay of political, social, and economic factors:

                Political Causes: The roots of the conflict lie in decades of ethnic tensions and the Myanmar government's refusal to recognize the Rohingya as citizens. This political exclusion has created an environment where violence and ethnic cleansing could take place with little accountability.
                
                Ethnic and Religious Tensions: The Rohingya, a Muslim minority in a predominantly Buddhist country, have faced religious persecution and targeted violence from extremist groups. This sectarian divide has fueled social hatred, making the Rohingya a scapegoat for broader societal problems in Myanmar.
                
                Economic Marginalization: Rohingya communities have been systematically denied access to economic opportunities, resulting in widespread poverty. Without land rights or access to jobs, their communities struggled with food insecurity and poor living conditions, contributing to the desire to seek refuge elsewhere.
                
                Military Crackdowns: The Myanmar military's operations in Rakhine State, particularly the 2017 campaign, were characterized by widespread violence, including massacres, sexual violence, and the burning of villages. The military's actions have been described by the United Nations as having "genocidal intent."</p>
